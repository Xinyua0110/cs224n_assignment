# cs224n_assignment

## here's the first two assignment(coding part) in cs224n

### a1 

* creates an environment with dependencies specified in env.yml( which is not included in GitHub )
* simply explore the word vectors
  * caculate co-occurrence matrix 
  * compute the dictionary that maps word to index
  * performs dimensionality reduction on the matrix
  * Implement plot_embeddings

### a2

* Written part : Understanding word2vec
  * more details are in the pdf
* Coding part : Implementing word2vec
  * creates an environment with dependencies specified in env.yml( which is not included in GitHub,and different from that in a1 )
  * run word2vec.py
  * run sgd.py
  * Run sh get datasets.sh.
  * run run.py
  * After 40,000 iterations, the script  fifinish and a visualization for my word vectors is saved as **word vectors.png**
